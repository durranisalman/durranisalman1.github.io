Distance distributions can be applied to study important wireless network characteristics such as interference, outage probability, connectivity, routing, and energy consumption. They can also be applied in other branches of science, such as forestry, mathematics, operations research and material sciences. When a fixed and finite number of nodes are uniformly and independently distributed over a finite region such as a square or hexagon (polygon in general), the two important distance distributions are: 1) the pdf of the Euclidean distance between two nodes uniformly and independently distributed inside a polygon and 2) the pdf of the Euclidean distance between any arbitrary reference point and its nth neighbor node when N nodes are uniformly and independently distributed inside a polygon.
