Signals that are inherently defined on the unit sphere appear in various fields of science and engineering such as medical image analysis, geodesy, computer graphics, planetary science, electromagnetic inverse problems, cosmology, 3D beamforming and wireless channel modeling.

Specific contributions include extension of Euclidean signal processing techniques to the sphere and development of new spatio-spectral signal transformation and filtering techniques.
