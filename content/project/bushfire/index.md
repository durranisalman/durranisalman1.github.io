The basic goal of this project is to develop an IoT (internet of things) ground-based sensor system to provide rapid detection of fires in their early stages. This project is funded through the [ANU Bushfire Research Centre of Excellence](https://brcoe.org/project/ground-based-iot-sensor-networks/). The project has resulted in two journal papers and 1 conference paper so far, where I am a co-author.

Specific contributions include: 

- Survey paper on IoT Ground Sensing Systems for Early Wildfire Detection: [[Magazine paper]](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3501336)  
- Machine learning based detection algorithm: [[Journal paper]](https://s-durrani.com/publication/)
- Statistical detection algorithm: [[Conference paper]](https://s-durrani.com/publication/)
