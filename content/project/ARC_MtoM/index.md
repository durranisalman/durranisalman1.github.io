This was an ARC Discovery Project DP170100939(https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/Web/Grant/Grant/DP170100939). I was lead-CI in the project. 

Novel solutions for data transmission, low-power backscatter transmission and wireless power transfer have been proposed to provide faster data rate, more reliable connectivity and prolonged network lifetime for machine-to-machine communications and Internet of Things devices and networks. The research outcomes were published in 27 journal papers and 20 conference papers. This includes several highly cited papers. The project involved successful collaboration with researchers from Canada, USA and Hong Kong. The project provided research training to one postdoc and 3 PhD students.
