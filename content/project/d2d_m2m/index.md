D2D communication allowing direct communication between nearby users has been envisaged in 3GPP standards. In D2D-enabled cellular networks, the cellular and D2D users can share the spectrum resources in two ways: in-band where D2D communications utilizes the cellular spectrum and out-of-band where D2D communications utilizes the unlicensed spectrum. In-band D2D can be further divided into two categories: overlay where the cellular and D2D communications use orthogonal (i.e., dedicated) spectrum resources and underlay where D2D users share the same spectrum resources occupied by the cellular users

Machine type communication (MTC) is also envisaged to play a key role within future fifth generation networks. MTC can be classified intotwo types:massive machine type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable machine type communication(uMTC).

Specific contributions include D2D mode selection, resource allocation and stochastic analysis and massive MTC solutions.
