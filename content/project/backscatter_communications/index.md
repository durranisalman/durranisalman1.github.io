Radio frequency (RF) enabled simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) has emerged as an attractive solution to power future wireless networks. There are three main architectures for SWIPT: (i) integrated SWIPT enables information and power to be extracted from the same signal transmitted by a base station, (ii) closed-loop SWIPT utilizes downlink from base station to users for power transfer (PT) and uplink for information transmission (IT), and (iii) decoupled SWIPT overlays traditional cellular networks with special power beacons (PBs), which do not require a backhaul link, to provide dedicated PT.

Specific contributions include (i) SWIPT for relaying, cooperative, ad hoc, physical layer security and sensor network scenarios, (ii) decoupled SWIPT (i.e., power beacons) for ad hoc and millimeter wave networks and (iii) Backscatter communications for ultra low power communications in Internet of Things (IoT).
