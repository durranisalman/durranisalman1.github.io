This was an ARC Discovery Project DP150101011(https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/Web/Grant/Grant/DP150101011). I was a co-CI in the project.

Novel solutions for sampling and spherical signal processing have been proposed to process data in real world applications such as biomedical imaging, astronomy and acoustic signal processing. The research outcomes were published in 8 journal papers and 12 conference papers. The project involved successful collaborations with researchers from Europe. The project provided research training to 4 postdocs and 2 PhD students.

My PhD student and later postdoc Zubair Khalid was funded through this grant. Zubair Khalid was a part of the team which recently won the prestigious [Gordon Bell Prize for Climate Modelling](https://awards.acm.org/bell-climate).
