Machine learning is expected to play a key role in 6G wireless networks. Many of my past and current PhD students have used machine learning tools and paradigms in their research. This research work is carried out using [NCI Australia](https://nci.org.au/) computing facilities.

Examples include:

- Unsupervised learning in IRS-Assisted Monostatic Backscatter Systems: [[Journal paper]](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3355317) and [[Conference paper]](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746747)
- Attention-Based BiLSTM Network for grant free NOMA: [[Journal]](https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2023.3292820)
- Federated learning for IoT networks:[[Journal paper]](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2022.3165596) and [[Conference paper]](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCWorkshops53468.2022.9814533)
- Transfer learning for IRS: [[Conference paper]](https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569500)

 I am keen to recruit more PhD students in this area. If you are interested, please contact me.
