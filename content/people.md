I am passionately committed to the supervision of research students. 

To date, I have supervised 100 students including 4 Postdoctoral Research Fellows, 15 PhD students (12 graduated), 6 Master of Engineering Hons students, 31 Bachelor of Engineering Research & Development students and 44 Bachelor of Engineering Research Hons students. 

Please see my CV for full details, including student awards and honours and career outcomes. The details about my current and past PhD students are below.
